# Curmin: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Curmin mobile application for Android!

This is an open source Android application developed by myself, Tarik Yasar. The source code is available on Github and the app is also available on Google Play.

I have not developed this application to collect any personally identifiable information. Application is able to connect to internet only to gather currency information. Also application does not store any information on the device itself either.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regardin how the application protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it.

Tarik Yasar.
